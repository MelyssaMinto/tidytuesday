# Starbucks Drinks

With this [Starbucks dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-12-21), I was curious to see if the increased caffiene for the larger drink sizes could justify a venti over a short. 


## Data Cleaning 
The data was pretty clean with the exception of the duplicate entires for the Iced Caff√® Mocha. There were duplicate entries with different nutritional value amounts (i.e. calories, sugars) with out any explainable difference in the dataset. I imagine that something like a chococlate drizzle could explain this variation but it was not captured in the dataset. I focued on Chai Lattes since I dont drink coffee.

I subsetted the data for Starbuck's Speciatly drinks. I ended up filtering the data for "short", "tall", and "venti" sizes, filtering for whole milk, and filtering for no whip cream. I then calculated the percent difference in calories and caffiene in sizes.

## Thoughts 
I am not a frequent buyer of starbucks but I was suprised to see the Chai menu items as I had never seen them before. It would have been great to get a dataset where each component of a drink (i.e. shot of coffee, pump of chai, whip cream) had its own calorie and caffiene values so that I could recreate my Starbucks order and calculate whether my order is "worth it"
